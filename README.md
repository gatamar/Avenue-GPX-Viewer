For easier management, future updates will be distributed on the Mac App Store. You can still build your own copy using Xcode, if you wish.

Avenue is based on some codes over at [iOS-Open-GPX-Tracker](https://github.com/merlos/iOS-Open-GPX-Tracker).
This application was developed by the contributor of the project (me), initally as a personal use app,
eventually it is developed to being more complete, and that it can be expected to be improved on as time goes by.

## Features
- Shows GPX file contents on Apple Maps (Waypoint and Track point support)
- Display of total distance of the tracks 
- Dark mode support
- Minimap for easier locating in complicated tracks (can be disabled)
- Auto restore of previous settings when reopened (like chosen map source, etc)
- Support for third-party map sources
  - Open Street Map
  - Carto DB (with Retina Support)
  - OpenTopoMap
  - Wikimedia Foundation (with Retina Support)

## Upcoming features
- Display of total tracked time
- Documentation
